# PyMongo Installation Guide

## Prerequisites:
- **Python 3.6+** should be installed on your machine.
- **pip** should be available for package installation.

### Step 1: Verify Python Installation
Make sure Python is installed correctly. Open a terminal or PowerShell and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, it will display the version number. If not, [download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it, ensuring to check the box for **Add Python to PATH**.

### Step 2: Install `pip`
If `pip` is not installed, follow these steps:

1. Download the `get-pip.py` script using `curl` or directly from [this link](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).

2. Run the script to install `pip`:

   ```bash
   python get-pip.py
   ```

3. If you get a warning that `pip.exe` is not in your PATH, refer to Step 3 to fix the PATH issue.

### Step 3: Add `pip` to PATH (if necessary)
If `pip` is installed but still not recognized in PowerShell or Command Prompt, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `Scripts` directory where `pip.exe` is installed. For example:

   ```
   C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts
   ```

2. Add this directory to your system's PATH:
   - Open **Start**, search for **Environment Variables**, and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
   - Click on **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **User variables**, find **Path** and click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add the directory where `pip.exe` is located.
   - Click **OK** to save.

3. Restart your terminal to apply the changes.

### Step 4: Install PyMongo
Once `pip` is available, use the following command to install **PyMongo**:

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

Alternatively, if `pip` isn't recognized in the terminal, navigate to the `Scripts` directory and use:

```bash
.\pip install pymongo
```

### Step 5: Verify Installation
After installing, verify that **PyMongo** is successfully installed by running the following Python script:

```python
import pymongo
print(pymongo.__version__)
```

This should display the installed version of **PyMongo**.
